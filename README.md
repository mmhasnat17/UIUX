## Desktop App WireFrame (MacBook Pro)

### Description

The purpose of this Figma Canvas demo is to go over sketch references low-fidelity wireframe, and high-fidelity wireframe
of the product details page, product size selected, product notification add to bag, product image scroller.

### Issue Resolved

Product Details: UX/UI inspired by the Ridgeline website. Based on the Double Diamond Structure User-Centered Design thinking, I sketched a reference wireframe, accumulated
ideal photograph assets, icons, and product texts to design the first iteration of product details page.

* Top Nav Bar contains: Shop, Contact, About, Sign Up, LogIn Button, and Cart
* The first and third quadrant consist of the Model image enlarged and small for scroll functionality
* The second and fourth quadrant consist of Product Name, description, Price, Color, Size, and Add to Bag Button
* By default, color Yellow is selected hence bold border

Product Size XL Selected: Branch iteration of the product details page. Size XL is selected hence bold border

Product Add-to-Bag Notification: Iteration of Product Size XL Sected page. Red notification added to the cart symbol to signify something was added to bag.

Product Image Scroller: Branch Iteration of Product Details page. Added functional scroll to move to next and previous image. 
In order to see this functionlality, please click restart in the bottom right.

## Reflection

The finalized UI/UX design may require additional divergent and convergent thinking process.
In additon, we could implement the Ten Usability Hueristics to further enhance the quality of the UI/UX prototype.
User Research from qualitative surveys or focus group are high advised. Business and other important stakeholders needs to define and approve the final acceptance criteria.
